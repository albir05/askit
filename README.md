This project is a full-stack web application inspired by Stack Overflow. It provides a platform for users to post questions, share answers, upvote/downvote content, and interact with other users. The back-end is built using Django with Python, and the front-end uses HTML, CSS (Bootstrap for responsive design), and JavaScript for interactivity.
